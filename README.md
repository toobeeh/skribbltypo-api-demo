# Typo Api Demo Project
This repository is a simple demonstration project for the typo API.
It consists of a simple svelte (a web framework) web page, and the typo API which is generated by the API docs.  
The typo API enables a developer to perform or automate many actions on the typo platform, like managing a user or reading data.  
API features can be found and tested here: https://api.typo.rip/docs

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. Run `npm run dev` in the root directory
4. Open the logged URL in your browser

## Update the API
This repository automatically generates API clients with a command line script.   
This means that there is ready-to-use code to interact with typo, and it's always up-to-date and correct! ;)   
When new features are published, the API client needs to be updated.  
Run `npm run generate:api` in the root directory to update the API. 

## Structure
- The API client files are generated to /src/api
- The svelte web page entrypoint is /src/main.ts
- The web page uses components located in src/lib
- To create API clients, the ApiFactory in src/util has to be used, like demonstrated in the example code
